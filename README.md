> 28/11/2025: This plugin was not your typical plugin and not your recommendation. It could potentially flood your console log with server based events. Either way, I'm not planning to continue this plugin nor even improve my English on this README
# General
A PocketMine plugin that allows you to see what players are doing and interacting!

**(Annoying plugin alert!)**

This plugin is on development. So help me if you want to by making a pull request.

# How This Works
- Download and place the plugin to folder `/plugin` in your server directory
- Start the server
- Once someone is joining the server (can be actually you), you will be notified by message like: `Steve was joined and he's the first time joining this server!` or `Steve was joined again!`
- [All examples will be linked to this text](https://github.com/keenanyafiqy/PlayerDetectsExample)

# How To Disable This Plugin
- Go to `plugin_list.yml` and then type `PlayerDetects` in the middle of `[]`

# List Events Used
This plugin is using **36 PLAYER EVENTS** (almost all) to make this works

# Idea
This idea plugin was from me ([@keenanyafiqy](https://github.com/keenanyafiqy))

# Config & Settings UI
_This will be added in next update, it will have an settings that can enable or disable an events_

_Otherwise, you could do that in config.yml_

_But that's not the time._

# ToDo Next
- Config
- Settings
